### Hi there!
I'm Kai Cui, currently a first-year master's student in University of Wisconsin-Madison MSDS program.

- I'm currently working on [QSBP](https://github.com/Ark-Kai/quant-stat-baby-project/), a baby program aiming to discover some fundamental data in the A-share market and help future quantitative research.
- I once interned in the [Enterprise Business Department at JD](https://www.jdbusiness.com/jdaboutus.html), where I was responsible for processing and analyzing profit and loss data. The data dashboard that I built had a page view of thousands.
- ..., by buying my girlfriend *Bella Sun* [a cup of coffee](https://www.starbucks.com.hk/zh_HK/mobile-applications-online-order-pick-up), you can see me work even harder.

**Q: What's your plan after graduating?**\
A: I don't have a specific plan yet. LLMs have greatly changed my expectations for the job market. I am concurrently applying for a second master's/PhD and autumn recruitment. Canada and Australia may be my destinations in life, and Hong Kong may be a transit stop.
